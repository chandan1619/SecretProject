# Here are the steps -

# step 1 - Reading the data from xml file and picking the fields inside object tags

# step 2 - making a Node class to represent a Tree Node with same properties as there for attributes of object tag in xml file

# Step 3 - creating object of Node class corresponding to object tag and storing them in a list

# step 4 -sorting the object based on the area of bounding box (bounding box whose area is most will come first and so on)


# step 5 - defining a funtion which basically check whether a object(Node) is inside a object(Node) based on properties of object tag like (xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)


# step 6 - creating parent child relationship for all the nodes in the tree

# step 7 - Linking parent with child node

# step 8 -Doing a BFS traversal over the tree

# step 9 - I have hashed the preorder traversal of the representation of entire subtree and then check their number of occurence to find similar componenets
